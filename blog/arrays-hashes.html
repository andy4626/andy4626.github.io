<h1>Arrays</h1>
<p>Array can hold A set of data.  Notice how I emphasized "a" set.  It can hold any type of objects of data.  It can be thought as list of data.  And many different functions can be done on an array.  
 The array can be written as following/:
 desired_array_name = ["string", numbers, booleans, floats, another array, and_more]
</p>
<h1>Hashes</h1>
<p>Hash can also hold collection of pair of information.  This may sound very vague, but it is simply data that is paired. 
A hash can be written as following/:
desired_hash_name= {"first_name" => "Andrew", "last_name" => "Kim", "age" => 28}
Make sure to pair the data with an arrow sign : =>
 </p>
<h1>The comparison and the difference</h1>
<p>Arrays and hashes are the places where the data can be stored in a different way.  They both hold objects such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
The major differece is that hashes has no limits on storage so the data can be inserted however many times as one wishes to.  Another major differene between the two is that hashes hold a pair of data whereas arrays can hold a set of data.  That means that hashes can hold a name and a value.  The arrays just take a data.  For example, hashes can hold personal information, like first name or last name and store a value.  In the other hand, arrays can hold a list of names in a classroom.  If one does not know which one is useful for what, hash can be used to look up an information faster.
Another major difference is that arrays can store another set of arrays within themselves
