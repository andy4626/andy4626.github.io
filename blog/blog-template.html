How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
At first, it was difficult to picture how my pair was thinking of the layout.  So we just went to mockingbird wireframe website and started putting down out thoughts and then commentedon them. We switched back and forth and shared our pros and cons.
JS fiddle was easy to work with, but whenever the partner was working on it the other person's page went to the top which was annoying.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, It was very helpful in a sense that we were able to layout our thoughts and ideas on a paper format.  

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
Having same ideas on which tabs are required and their functions.  It was a great idea that we were on the same page because even conflicting ideas were persuaded by explaining its necessity.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
My partner was very advanced at HTML5.  He had prior experience and he guided through with new tabs that I've never heard about.  He even gave me a cheat sheet for HTML5 that I am gonna need to study.
