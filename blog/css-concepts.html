<h1>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h1>

<p>I got confused with these layers of text when I started learning CSS.  I started to think of them as layers around your text by thinking like this: think about different shells around an onion for these terminologies for the text.  The order from inside to outside is padding, borders and margin.  
Padding is the inner most shell and is the region between borders and texts itself.  It is not containing any space as default and it is the only layer that is touching the text itself
Borders is the space between padding and margin, like a halo around the texts or the word border itself.  It can be thought as the main protective layer.
And margin is the outer most shell of the text which defines and the space till the next element or text.  It can add spacings to the outer most element.

<h1>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>

<p>This was the first questions I asked while I was learning CSS.  The answers that I found and heard was simple and clear.  ID is just for a specific elemtent.  For instance, if it is one tab of html that I want to decorate using CSS, I would give an ID of the tab and put CSS on top of it.  In the other hand, classes can be used on groups.  Such as group of tabs containing texts can be named using classes and put CSS on them.

<h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning?</h1>
<p>
There are four different positioning in CSS.  They're called relative, absolute, fixed and statis positions.  I am still beginner stage to explain these but to explain it to someone like he/she is a five years old, I would say that fixed position stays at the same spot even though I scrolled down or up.  If it was positioned at the center or the stage, it will be at the center of the stage even if the stage is moved.  Absolute positioning is absolutely positioned.  It is not affected by other elements.  It will stay at the point A and B or the page if we name it to.  The total opposite of absolute positoining will be static.  It is not affected by top, bottom, left or right.  It is positioned accrording to the flow of the html page.  Lastly, relative positioning is positioned at its normal position.  The most easy-going and relaxed positions where it is moved it affect by elements.

<h1>What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?</h1>
<p>
These displays can be explained with three terms: inline, block and inline-block elements. Inline elemtns are not affect by top and bottom and affected by left and right.  And it does not have a width ad height setttings and it allows all elements to sit right next to each other.  In the other hand, inline block has settings top and bottom and have height and width, which is edifferent from inline elements. </p>
