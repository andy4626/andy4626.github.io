      <h3>Looping in Ruby vs Javascript</h3>
<p>
When I was just getting used to Ruby, I was introduced to the world of JavaScript.  One of the first concepts that I was interested in was looping: what are the differences and similarities on how they are written.  So I decided do a little research and write something about it.  There are four type of looping in general: for, while, until, or loop do.  I will iterate through each concepts and show the differences and similarities.
</p>
<p>If loops for Ruby.
The basic syntax is written as: 
if (condition is true)
  action_that_you_desire
end

This if loops will execute the action_that_you_desire until the condition is not met.  Pretty simple, yet setting the condition must be well executed or it will go into an infinite loop. 
</p>
<p>
If loops for JavaScript.
The basic syntax is written as: 
if(condition){execute this function}

Javascript will execute the desired function until the condition inside the parenthesis is met.
</p>
<p>
For loops for Ruby
The basic syntax is written as: 
i=0
for i<10
(execute_this_function)
i++
end

Ruby will execute this function ten times, until the variable i becomes 9.  
</p>
<p>

for loops for JavaScript
The basic syntax is written as: 
for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){action_that_you_desire}

There are three slots or conditions, that is separated by semi-colons, that are necessary for this for loop to work.  For first slot(var i=0), is setting a counter variable for the loops to work.  The second slot(i<5) is the condition given to the for loop to break out.  The last slot(i++) is incrementation done on the counter.  These three slots don’t need to be all filled out, if the condition is not necessarily needed.  
</p>

<p>
While loops for Ruby 
The basic syntax is written as: 
while (this_condition)
execute_this_function
end

While the condition is met for the while loop, it will run the function until this condition is met false.
</p>
<p>
While loops for Javascript
The basic syntax is written as: 
while(condition_is_met){execute_this_function}

Same as the while loops for Ruby but different syntax
</p>
<p>
Until loops for Ruby
The basic syntax is written as: 
until (condition is met)
execute_this_function
end

So this until loop will execute the function until the condition is met and stop the for loop.  Simple, yet so effective
