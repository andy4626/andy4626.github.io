And margin is the outer most shell of the text which defines and the space till the next element or text.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Easiest part was choosing texts and colors.  The most difficult part was positioning them.  Once I placed the navigation menus, I wanted to make buttons or directories bigger when the mouse was hovering over it.  But the actual button did get bigger but the whole navigation bar became bigger.  I did trial and error, different positions and way more to try fixing and figuring it out, but couldn't.  WIll probably be my next office our question.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I just learned huge tons of stuff.  I learned how to put a horizontal line instead of putting <hr> on the HTML, The biggest knowledge or the concept I gained would be choosing the right tabs of HTML for CSS to decorate over. I wish to improve a lot more on positioning.
