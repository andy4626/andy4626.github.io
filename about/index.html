      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p> 
Andrew Kim is soon to be a DevBootCamp graduate and software developer. He made the transition from dentistry when he decided to choose a career that he is truly passionate about.  
</p>
<p>
Andrew was born in Flushing, New York but was raised in South Korea until college. He graduated from Syracuse University  with a major in biology and  he obtained his masters in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Medicine and Dentistry in NJ. 
</p>
<p>
Some of his hobbies are coding and playing basketball. Most importantly, he collects Jordan shoes and loves to share the most unique ones with his friends. He is not only athletic but surprisingly very sensitive - he is a musical prodigy in piano.
